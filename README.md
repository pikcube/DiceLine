# Dice Line

A utility for rolling dice using the command line.

The syntax is just DiceLine d20 to roll a d20.

If you want to roll multiple, you can do that with 2d6.

Want to add static mods. Go for it 3d10+5.

Roll multiple types of dice at once? Sure! 2d10+3d6+5

Need to subtract a modifier or a die. That works too! d20-d6-2+3
